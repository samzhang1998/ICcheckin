## Implementation Notes

### Responsive Design Approach
- Use existing components with responsive enhancements
- Implement a two-column layout for PC screens
- Maintain consistent styling between mobile and PC versions

### Key Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px (default)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: â‰¥ 1024px

### Code Structure
```vue
<template>
  <!-- PC Layout -->
  <pc-layout v-if="isPc">
    <!-- PC-specific layout -->
  </pc-layout>
  
  <!-- Mobile Layout -->
  <view v-else>
    <!-- Original mobile layout -->
  </view>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      isPc: false
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Check device on mount and window resize
    this.checkDevice();
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.checkDevice);
  },
  methods: {
    checkDevice() {
      this.isPc = window.innerWidth >= 768;
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
