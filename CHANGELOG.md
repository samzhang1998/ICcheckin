# Changelog - March 31, 2025

## Google Maps API Improvements

### 1. Fixed Google Maps Loading Warning
- **Issue**: The Google Maps JavaScript API was being loaded without the `loading=async` attribute, causing suboptimal performance.
- **Solution**: Added `loading=async` parameter to the Google Maps script URL in both map components.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/home/map-location.vue`
  - `src/components/profile/attendance-tracking.vue`
- **Benefits**: Improved page loading performance and removed console warning.

### 2. Addressed Marker Deprecation Warning
- **Issue**: Google Maps is deprecating `google.maps.Marker` in favor of `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement`.
- **Solution**: Initially attempted to migrate to Advanced Markers API but encountered compatibility issues. Reverted to standard Markers with `loading=async` for better compatibility while maintaining performance improvements.
- **Note**: According to Google, the current Marker API will continue to work for at least 12 more months, so this is not an urgent issue.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/home/map-location.vue`
  - `src/components/profile/attendance-tracking.vue`

### 3. Improved Map Route Indicators
- **Enhancement**: Changed the route order indicators in the profile page map from orange markers to dark blue circles with white numbers.
- **Benefits**: Better visual clarity and improved user experience when following the sequence of locations.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/profile/attendance-tracking.vue`

## Implementation Details

### Map Location Component
- Updated Google Maps script loading to use `loading=async` parameter
- Maintained standard marker implementation for compatibility
- Improved map initialization and marker handling

### Attendance Tracking Component
- Updated Google Maps script loading to use `loading=async` parameter
- Enhanced route visualization with custom styled markers
- Improved numbered indicators using dark blue circles with white numbers
- Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

## Future Considerations
1. **Advanced Markers Migration**: Consider a more comprehensive migration to the Advanced Markers API in the future, with proper feature detection and fallbacks.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize map loading and rendering for better mobile performance.
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance map accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## How to Test Changes
1. Check the browser console - the loading warning should be resolved
2. The marker deprecation warning may still appear (this is expected and not critical)
3. Verify that maps load and display correctly in both components
4. In the profile page, confirm that route indicators now appear as dark blue circles with white numbers
